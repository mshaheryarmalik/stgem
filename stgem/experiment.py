"""
Notice that the callbacks need to understand that calls can arrive out of
order.

The result callback is called with three parameters idx, result, done. The
variable idx indicates the index of the replica that has just been completed
and the result variable contains the SUTResult corresponding to this replica.
The list done indicates what other replicas have completed before, that is,
it is a list of complete replicas without the current index.
